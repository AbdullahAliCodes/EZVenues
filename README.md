# EZVenuez – University Venue Booking System

EZVenuez is a user-friendly desktop application built with C# (Windows Forms) and Microsoft Access for efficient venue management in a university setting. Developed by EZPeazy Solutions as part of a group project, it simplifies the booking process for students and lecturers, while offering administrative controls for venue and user management.

## 👥 User Roles
- **Student**: Register, log in, and book venues.
- **Lecturer**: View, manage, and update their bookings.
- **Admin**: Manage users, bookings, and generate usage reports.

## ✅ Key Features
- Account creation and login for students, lecturers, and admins.
- Real-time venue availability and automated conflict prevention.
- View, create, update, or cancel bookings.
- Admin dashboard to manage user data and generate reports.
- Loyalty point system and VAT calculation for clothing purchases (Form1.cs).

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **C# (Windows Forms)**
- **Microsoft Access** (used as the local database)

## 🧠 How It Works
1. **Login or Register** as a student, lecturer, or admin.
2. **Browse venues** filtered by capacity and availability.
3. **Book a venue** at a valid timeslot (double-booking is prevented).
4. **Admin tools** allow editing of user data and viewing booking stats.
